# Katunog API Project

## Overview

The Katunog project is a comprehensive initiative developed by the Department of
Science and Technology (DOST) to create a music database of Philippine
indigenous instruments and make them available to the public. The project's
primary objective is to bridge the gap between traditional music practices and
the current generation by providing an online portal containing rich
descriptions, sound variations, and related multimedia of various Philippine
musical instruments.
